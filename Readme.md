# Onboarding Form
**This is a simple form which has a 3 step form filling procedure for creating a sort of a workspace on this site called Eden 
where each form page has a input that is required  and a final confirmation page**
---
### ** Used React with Boostrap **

#### the file structure is as shown below
1. Assets
--* this file consists of the logos used
2. Components
--* Consists of the common components that can be reused such as Button(ActionButton), Call to action(CalltoAction) and Logo which has company name (Logo)
3. Pages
--* This consist of diffferent pages that will be added to the overall app, however only onboarding is done here
--* Here there is **Onboading** file which has subfolders as Form and UI
--* Form consist of all the 3 form components that will need to be filled( form1, form2, form3) and a completed final form.
--* UI components has the Steps shown on the 4 forms which shows the progress

#### Basic concepts used
*So this was kinda my attempt of creating a small project based on the lessons i have learnt*
_Props, css modules and overall use of bootstrap_ 

#### Things that need fixing
1. On form 3 I need the selected button to remain highighted once the button is clicked so user can see that he has selected an option
2. I have added a basic alert system to throw an error if the required fields are not filled, a better UI representation would do
3. Well I have used props and the data entered is not stored but i have added points where they are obtained in the forms
  however I think using redux would be a good step.
